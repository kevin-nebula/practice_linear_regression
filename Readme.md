# Linear Regression with Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model using synthetic data generated with `sklearn.datasets.make_regression`. The model is evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics.

## Installation

You can run this project directly on Google Colab without any local installation.
